I would like to apologize in advance for the late submission, there were a couple of things I couldn't figure out the issue with and I am already past due on time so I just have to move on!

For input[16] for some reason my line graph wont show up. As far as I can tell I have done the coding correctly and it should be showing up but for some reason it just stays blank. I tried a few different fixes/styles and nothing seemed to work, and I couldn't spend any more time on it. My sincerest apologies.

For inputs[10]/[17] this message is printed out before the appropriate graph is displayed: 

<function matplotlib.pyplot.show(close=None, block=None)>

in both cases the bar and the correlation/regression graphs showed the appropriate information and matched up with what was on the example. As such I didn't spend to much time on it but I couldn't figure out what was causing the issue.
